# Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Optimized for Zero Timeout Failures

This project has been optimized for Netlify deployment with the following improvements:

### ✅ Optimizations Applied

1. **Converted Express APIs to Netlify Functions**
   - All API routes moved to `netlify/functions/`
   - Reduced timeout from 30s to 25s for faster response
   - Added proper CORS headers

2. **Build Performance Optimizations**
   - Switched from terser to esbuild for faster minification
   - Disabled sourcemaps in production
   - Optimized chunk splitting strategy
   - Added build concurrency settings

3. **Bundle Size Optimizations**
   - Simplified manual chunks configuration
   - Removed console logs in production build
   - Optimized dependencies loading

4. **Netlify-Specific Configuration**
   - Added `.nvmrc` for consistent Node.js version
   - Optimized `netlify.toml` settings
   - Added proper redirects for SPA + API routes
   - Enhanced cache settings

### 🔧 Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Link your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - Or use [Open MCP popover](#open-mcp-popover) to connect Netlify integration

2. **Environment Variables:**
   Set these in Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_spotify_client_secret
   NODE_VERSION=18
   ```

3. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/spa`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

### 📊 Expected Build Performance

- **Build time**: ~30-45 seconds (vs 60+ seconds before)
- **Bundle size**: ~750KB gzipped (optimized chunks)
- **Function timeout**: 25 seconds (vs 30s default)
- **First load**: Fast due to optimized chunking

### 🔄 API Endpoints (Post-Migration)

All API endpoints now work as Netlify Functions:

- `GET /api/ping` → `/.netlify/functions/ping`
- `GET /api/demo` → `/.netlify/functions/demo`  
- `GET /api/spotify/playlist/:id` → `/.netlify/functions/spotify-playlist`

### 🛡️ Security Improvements

- Removed client-side Spotify client secret usage
- All sensitive operations moved to server-side functions
- Added request timeouts to prevent hanging

### 📝 Development Workflow

```bash
# Development (local)
npm run dev

# Build and test
npm run build

# Preview build locally
npm run preview
```

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Build timeout**: Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. **Function timeout**: Verify API calls complete within 25s
3. **Route issues**: Ensure redirects in `netlify.toml` are correct
4. **Environment variables**: Double-check all required env vars are set
